/*LEFT(RIGHT) OUTER JOIN 或者LEFT(RIGHT) JOIN ，when one table（table_null） is null */
1、SELECT id_name.id , id_name.name FROM id_name LEFT OUTER JOIN table_null ON id_name.id = table_null.id;
   SELECT id_name.id , id_name.name FROM id_name RIGHT OUTER JOIN table_null ON id_name.id = table_null.id;

2、 SELECT id_name_null.id , id_name_null.name FROM id_name_null LEFT OUTER JOIN table_null ON id_name_null.id = table_null.id;
    SELECT table_null.id , table_null.name FROM id_name_null RIGHT OUTER JOIN table_null ON id_name_null.id = table_null.id;

3、/*group by Table： id_name */     ------>Group By本身就有Distinct的作用。
SELECT id,name FROM id_name GROUP BY id,name;

SELECT id,COUNT(name) FROM id_name GROUP BY id,name;

SELECT id,COUNT(name) AS name_cnt FROM id_name GROUP BY id;


/*group by Table： id_name_null */

SELECT id,name FROM id_name_null GROUP BY id;

/*group by Table： table_null */

SELECT id,name FROM table_null GROUP BY id,name;


4、/* group by & order by ---对比如下：*/

SELECT id,name FROM id_name GROUP BY id,name;
SELECT id,name FROM id_name GROUP BY id,name ORDER BY id DESC;



5、
Having与Where的区别：

where 子句的作用是在对查询结果进行分组前，将不符合where条件的行去掉，即在分组之前过滤数据，where条件中不能包含聚组函数，使用where条件过滤出特定的行。

having 子句的作用是筛选满足条件的组，即在分组之后过滤数据，条件中经常包含聚组函数，使用having 条件过滤出特定的组，也可以使用多个分组标准进行分组。


/* Where、 group by、having：id_name */
SELECT id,name FROM id_name WHERE id > 1;
SELECT id,name FROM id_name WHERE id > 1 GROUP BY id,name;
SELECT id,name FROM id_name GROUP BY id,name HAVING SUM(id) > 2;
SELECT id,name FROM id_name WHERE id >4 GROUP BY id,name HAVING SUM(id) > 2;


1.	/* group by、having：id_name  & id_name_score 对比如下：*/

SELECT id,name FROM id_name GROUP BY id,name HAVING SUM(id) > 2;
 	
	SELECT id,name,score FROM id_name_score GROUP BY id,name HAVING SUM(id) > 2;
 	SELECT id,name,score FROM id_name_score GROUP BY id,name HAVING SUM(score) > 15;


2.	/* Where、 group by、having、 order by：id_name  & id_name_score 对比如下：*/

SELECT id,name FROM id_name WHERE id >3 GROUP BY id,name HAVING SUM(id) > 2 ORDER BY name;

 	SELECT id,name FROM id_name WHERE id >3 GROUP BY id,name HAVING SUM(id) > 2 ORDER BY name DESC;
	SELECT id,name,score FROM id_name_score WHERE id >1 GROUP BY id,name HAVING SUM(score) > 10 ORDER BY name DESC;
	SELECT id,name,score FROM id_name_score WHERE id >1 GROUP BY id,name,score HAVING SUM(score) > 10 ORDER BY name DESC;
	SELECT id,name,score FROM id_name_score WHERE id <10 GROUP BY id,name,score HAVING SUM(score) > 10 ORDER BY score;
	SELECT id,name,score FROM id_name_score WHERE id <10 GROUP BY id,name HAVING SUM(score) > 10 ORDER BY score;
	SELECT id,name,score FROM id_name_score WHERE id <10 GROUP BY id,name HAVING SUM(score) > 10 ORDER BY name;
    SELECT id,name,score FROM id_name_score WHERE id <10 GROUP BY id,name,score HAVING SUM(score) > 10 ORDER BY name;
